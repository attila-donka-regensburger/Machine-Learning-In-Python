Roadmap For Learning Machine Learning in Python

Probability and Statistics: First start with the basics of Mathematics. Learn all the basics of statistics like mean, median and mode. topics like Regression, curve fitting are also important.

Graphs for visualization: Various graph plots like bar graphs, scatter plots, line plots, line plots etc. are important for data visualization.

Programming Language: A programming language is a must to learn ML. Because, we can depend for complex mathematical operations on a computer but, to fetch, represent and analyze data they prove to be most useful. Python and R are most famous among the Data Science enthusiasts ad ML engineers.

Libraries: We need to have strong understanding of various development libraries for data analysis of the programming language we choose for ML. They help us in numerical computing, data preprocessing, easy algorithm implementation and to visualize the data.

Algorithms: Various algorithms are important for various predictions. Naive Bayse , Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBosst etc. with their theory is important.

Data processing techniques: To convert raw data into useful and manageable one, we should have the skill of data preprocessing. Various encoding techniques like One Hat Encoding and Label Encoding are important.
